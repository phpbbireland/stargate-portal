Just some basic information re Stargate Portal

Originally named the Kiss Portal, Stargate Portal is the original (the first ever mod let alone portal) written for phpBB3.
The project began a couple of days after phpBB3 alpha SVN became available to the public...

Key features:
* Can be disable in ACP without affecting phpBB3 core... (your site will function as if it was never installed).
* Almost every aspect of the portal is controllable in the ACP...
* You can arrange all blocks as you wish by simply dragging and dropping them (into left/centre/right columns), 
* Blocks can also be hidden or unhidden....
* Blocks can be view on any page (any block or combination / any page or combination of pages)...
* You can determine which group/groups see which blocks...
* You can control who has access to (who can see) any menu and/or individual menu items...

... under construction ...
